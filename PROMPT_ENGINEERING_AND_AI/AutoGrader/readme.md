# Introduction

The Automatic Grading System revolutionizes the educational assessment process by automating the grading of assignments. By leveraging cutting-edge AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), this system offers educators an intuitive platform to generate rubrics and grade assignments efficiently, ensuring consistent and accurate evaluations.

# Relevance
In modern educational environments, the efficiency and consistency of grading are paramount. This system addresses the growing need for advanced solutions that streamline the grading process, making it highly relevant for educational institutions ranging from K-12 schools to universities. By enhancing productivity and fairness, the project contributes significantly to improved educational outcomes.

# Problem Formulation
The Automatic Grading System tackles several critical challenges associated with traditional grading methods:

Time-Consuming Manual Grading: Educators often spend a considerable amount of time grading assignments, which detracts from valuable instructional time.
Inconsistent Grading Standards: Manual grading can lead to variability in standards, resulting in unfair assessments.
Adapting to Diverse Subjects: Creating rubrics and grading systems for varied subjects and educational levels is complex and labor-intensive.
Scalability Issues: Traditional grading methods do not easily scale to accommodate large student populations and diverse grading needs.

# Scope of the Project
The scope of the Automatic Grading System includes:

Prototype Development: Creating a prototype system that generates and applies grading rubrics across diverse educational contexts.
Scalable Architecture: Implementing a scalable system architecture to ensure optimal performance and responsiveness.
AI and LLM Integration: Utilizing advanced AI and LLM algorithms to create precise and adaptable grading systems.
System Evaluation: Conducting rigorous testing and collecting feedback to evaluate system performance.
Comprehensive Documentation: Providing detailed guides for effective use by educators and developers.

# Data Modeling

The project integrates regx pattern to extract answers from the assignment, a robust vector database engine to store the assignment, with LLMs to enhance the grading process. This combination improves the systemâ€™s ability to understand diverse grading criteria, resulting in accurate and contextually relevant grading outcomes.

# Conclusion

The Automatic Grading System is a transformative solution in educational assessment. By harnessing advanced AI and LLM technologies, it aims to streamline the grading process, improve reliability, and ensure fairness. With a user-friendly interface and scalable architecture, this system is set to enhance educational productivity and outcomes.
